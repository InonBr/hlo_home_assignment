## Run the app locally instructions

1. In the terminal enter the project repository.
2. In the email I have sent you, there is a `.env` file, please place it in the base folder of the app.
3. Run `yarn install` in order to install all of the dependencies required for the project.
4. Run `yarn start` in order to run the app locally on `port 5000`.
