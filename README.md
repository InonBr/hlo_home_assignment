# Home Assignment

The fully working product was deployed to Heroku, the url is: https://hlohomeassignment.herokuapp.com/
I've attached to the email a postman file so you can test the working product both locally and online.

If you wish to test the app locally, please clone this directory and fallow understand how to run the application.

## Run the app locally instructions

1. In the terminal enter the project repository.
2. In the email that I sent you, there is a `.env` file, please place it in the base folder of the app.
3. Run `yarn install` in order to install all of the dependencies required for the project.
4. Now, run `yarn start` in order to run the app locally on `port 5000`.
